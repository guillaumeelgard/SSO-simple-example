# Introduction

[According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on), “Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.”

This repository is a short example of how SSO can be implemented using a few basic lines of PHP. **Please do not use it as is!**

# How to use

If you want to play with the code and/or run it locally, it is as simple as [Docker](https://www.docker.com) can be:
1. `docker-compose build`
2. `docker-compose up -d`
3. Visit <http://localhost:8301>, enjoy!
